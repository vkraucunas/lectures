## Best Practices of UI Design
~ Making good UI is like making a good relationship.
- UI = User Interface
    - User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use to facilitate those actions.
    - UI brings together concepts from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture.
- KNOW YOUR USERS
    - Think about the goals of people using your site => create defaults that align with these goals
    - Reduce the burden on the user
- KISS
    - Don't overwhelm your user visually
- COMMUNICATE
    - Organize the page in such a way that what is important is obvious
    - Tell your user what is happening!

## Visual hierarchy
- Have students read through brief article about VH. Summarize in their own words what VH is.
- VH is acheived through use of:
    - Headers (weight differences)
    - Whitespace
    - color

## Color theory
- Primary/secondary/tertiary colors
- Math way - palleton
- Kim Kardashian method
    - Highlight
    - Contour

## Reset vs normalize
