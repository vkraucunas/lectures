## Differentiate wireframes from mockups
* Wireframes are shapes or zones that denote structure of the page, with some brief explanation of what would go where
* Mockups look closer to what the final product will be. This would be something you would show a client.
- Whiteboards. Draw a "W" on it. I'm going to show you some examples and I want you to hold up your whiteboard oriented correctly so it is an M or W
